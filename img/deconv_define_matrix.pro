; NAME: DECONV_DEFINE_MATRIX
;
; PURPOSE:
;	This routine computes a transformation matrix describing FOXSI's imaging instrument 
;	response.  It is used for deconvolving FOXSI images.  It defines a matrix that 
;	computes the counts in each measured detector strip i due to each source pixel j.  
;	Source and expected image pixels can be sized differently.  No effective area or 
;	spectral response is included.
;
;	Notes:
;	-- The PSF must be >=3x the source image dimensions, and square.
;	-- No actual source is needed at this point.  This computes the transformation
;	   matrix that can be used for any source.  This matrix can be applied to any
;	   detector image with the specified pixel pitch and dimension.
;	-- It's not fast!  Computing the matrix with defaults takes several minutes
;	   on Lindsay's laptop.  There are several ways the routine could be developed to 
;	   compute the matrix more quickly.
;	-- The matrix roughly conserves flux for a centered source, so that most source and 
;	   measured images on each detector will roughly have the same number of photons.  
;      (100k photons/source => 100k photons on each detector.)  This might not be the 
;	   physical case -- for off-axis angles about half the flux might fall of the small 
;	   region of the detector considered here, but getting it right requires better 
;	   knowledge of the PSF wings than we currently have.  Please note that the effective 
;	   area of the instrument is NOT included in this routine.
;
; KEYWORDS:
;	PSF:	plot_map structure containing the point spread function.  The deconvolved 
;			image will have a pixel size equal to the PSF pixel size.  If no PSF is 
;			supplied then the default is an on-axis PSF with 1" pixels.  
;			The PSF FOV should be >3x the image FOV (MEASURED_DIM x STRIP PITCH) in order 
;			to allow for rotations and "full reach." 
;			across the detector.
;	MATRIX_FILE:	Save the matrix variable in an IDL save file of this name.
;					Default is 'matrix.sav' in current directory.
;					To use this routine for anything useful, the matrix must be saved.
;	MEASURED_DIM:	Number of strips across the image.  If this number is n, the 2D image 
;					has n^2 strip crossings. Default: 10 strips
;					This MUST match the size of the image you want to deconvolve.
;					Source map dimensions are calculated from this variable (and pitch 
;					and PSF pixel size) and so runtime goes as MEASURED_DIM^4.
;	PITCH:			Detector strip size in arcsec. Default: 7.735
;					This MUST match the strip size of the image you want to 
;					deconvolve.
;	DETECTOR_MASK:	Flags to show which detectors you want to include in the transform.
;					Detectors with zero flags just get zeroes for their transforms.
