;  This function takes a 2D position (or [2,N] array of positions) in detector pixel coordinates
;  and transforms it to payload coordinates.  For each detector, the origin is in its center.
; The returned coordinates account for the individual detector rotation as designed.
; Rotations or translations due to misalignments in the assembly are not included.
; 
; INPUTS:
; 	COORDS:		A 2xN array containing [x,y] positions in detector pixel coordinates
; 	DETECTOR:	Specifies the detector.  Each detector has a different rotation.
;
; RETURN VALUE: 	A 2XN array containing [x,y] positions in payload coordinates (arcseconds).
;			The reference frame is the same as that on the GSE.
