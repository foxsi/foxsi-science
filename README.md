# INSTALL

    You need to have IDL and SSW previously installed

    Include this five lines in your personal IDL_STARTUP file

    setenv,'FOXSIPKG=My/personal/path/to/foxsi-science'
    setenv,'FOXSIDB=My/other/personal/path/to/foxsidb'
    add_path,'$FOXSIPKG',/expand
    add_path,'$FOXSIDB'
    @init_param


    FOXSI-Data-Base Directory (FOXSIDB)
    
    Create a new folder called 'foxsidb' in a convenient location for you.
    Should include:
        
        Folder      Files

        data_2012   foxsi_level2_data.sav

        data_2014   foxsi_level2_data.sav


    You can download these two files from 

    2012: ftp://apollo.ssl.berkeley.edu/pub/foxsi/data_2012/

    2014: ftp://apollo.ssl.berkeley.edu/pub/foxsi/data_2014/

    To know whether your installation was a success, run @image-example-1
    and you should get an image of the first target.


Run SSWIDL and start up FOXSI by

    foxsi,year

year = 2014 or 2012

Example:
    
    foxsi,2014
